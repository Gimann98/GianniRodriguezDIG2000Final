	<h1>About Me</h1>
	<p class="lead">My name is Gianni Rodriguez and I am 21 years old. 
		This is my first semester here at UCF after transferring from Valencia College. 
		I am going for my Bacholor's Degree in Game Design. My biggest hobbies include playing video games and weightlifting
	but I also enjoy watching movies, shows, anime.</p>

	<h1>Image Editing</h1>
	<h3>In the beginning of the semester we learned a little about image editing.
	We tested with using the histogram in Photshop to change the look of an image and this is the image that I submitted.

	<h1>Audio Experience</h1>
	<h2>Social Media Interview</h2>
	<h3>During this portion of the class we learned about social media and the effects that it has on our data. Bigger companies such as Google use our data from social media
		and scew the advertisements we see based upon that information. We conducted an interview with someone we knew to get their thoughts and opinions about this subject. Unfortunately,
		I did not conduct said interview and therefore do not have anything to link for this section.
	</h3>
	<h2>Podcast Minisode</h2>
	<h3>I enjoyed this section of the class because I am an avid podcast listener so being able to learn about the process of how it is done was interesting.
		For this project we were assigned to create a minisode of us talking about whatever topic that we wanted, the main purpose was to show our understanding of the audio softwares. 
		I did my minisode on the people that think there is no money to be made from playing video games and how wrong they really are.</h3>

	<h1>Video Experience</h1>
	<h2>Digital Storytelling</h2>
	<h3>For this project we looked at telling a story through video and the many different ways of doing so. We were then tasked to create our own storytelling video after learning the things
	that we covered. For my video I told the story of one of my training days for weightlifting and my missed attempts at max weights. I told how, even though I was missing, I did not falter 
	and kept pushing forward to eventually make the weight. I think that the video turned out fairly well with the little experince I had with the editing program I was using.</h3>

	<h2>VFX</h2>
	<h3>This part of the class was unexpected for me because I never thought that it would be something that I would learn in a lower level class. I thought that VFX would not be something
	that I learned about until my later classes. I went relatively simple for my VFX video and decided to stick with lyric videos. I took a personal video of mine that was shorter and was 
	just general talk between me and my friend and matched the words to try and add a comedic effect to the video. I do not know if I achieved that goal but I think the video came out fine.</h3>

<!-- Start Challenges Section -->
<div id="challenges" class="offset">
	<h1>New Technologies Challenges</h1>
	<h2>Games</h2>
	<h3>Video games was one of the emerging technologies that we learned about during this section and I believe that they will help humanity. I may be biased based upon my personal liking of video games
	but I think that utilizing games in the right ways would boost moral and productivity. Imagine if when you go to school instead of using a textbook, pen, and paper you use a console and learn through 
	an interactive video game. This would be a lot more entertaining and therefore keep people more engaged so that they may actaully learn something and grow smarter.</h3>

	<h2>Deepfakes</h2>
	<h3>This is something that I can only see doing harm to the world. Deepfakes are able to copy almost the exact look of someone and make them do anything that you would want them to.
	This could be used to blackmail someone, imcriminate someone, make someone look bad, etc. There are so many bad outcomes that can come out of deepfaking someone that I think that this technology
	needs to be regulated in someway before it gets out of hand.
	</h3>

	<h2>VR/AR</h2>
	<h3>VR and AR are things that I think would be insanely beneficial to humanity when they are implented more. VR/AR could be used in universities to have virtual labs so that it cuts back on
	lab costs and allows students to do things that may not have been able to before. Same goes for the real world, using VR in medical centers would be amazing, being able to practice a procedure 
	or surgery in VR would be mounds better than on a real patient, there is no risk involved in VR.

	<h1>My Blog</h1>
	<h2>The creation of the blog was a little hard for me at first but after tinkering with the site for a bit I got the hang of it. In my blog I talked about the things that we learned in this class,
	one of them being the editing for brands tutorial that we learned in Photoshop at the beginning of the year. The main topic that I focused on though was what I thought we should have learned, and I thought
	that we should have learned more about gaming because of its rapid rise in popularity and success in the past years.</h2>
